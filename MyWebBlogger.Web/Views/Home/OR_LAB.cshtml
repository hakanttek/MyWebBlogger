<h1>Operation Resource Laboratory</h1>
<p><em>
    Operations research is a branch of science in which the best solution is found to solve the specified problem within certain constraints or the most appropriate method is analyzed to achieve a specific goal. It is an interdisciplinary science in which scientific methods such as mathematical modeling, statistics and algorithms are used together, which is used by many companies and sectors today. It will be the whole of the studies carried out to find the optimum.

<p><strong>Simplex: </strong>The Simplex Method is an algorithm (computational method) that approaches step by step to the best solution that will make the objective function the largest (maximum) or the smallest (minimum). Therefore, it allows us to start from one endpoint of the problem, jumping to a second one closer to the optimum, then to a third one... to reach the endpoint that gives the best solution.</p>

<p><strong>Branch-and-Bound: </strong> When searching for the optimal solution of an integer programming problem with the Branch-and-Bound Algorithm technique, all stages of the problem are analyzed systematically. Branching, bounding and linking operations are performed while finding the optimal solution with the Branch and Bound Algorithm technique. When an integer programming problem is solved by the simplex method without the requirement of being integer, sub-problems are created by selecting the branching variable from among the fractional variables x[j] in the optimal solution. The variable with the highest economic importance is determined as the branching variable. While branching the determined variable, the fractional value it takes in the optimal solution is considered to be between two integers and sub-problems are formed accordingly.</p>

<p>Below is a sample mathematical model. The opmization application will be activated as soon as possible.</p>

<div id="editor" style="font-family:Consolas">
    <p>var x;</p>
    <p>var y;</p>
    <p>4x + y ≥ 40;</p>
    <p>2x + 3y ≥ 90</p>
    <p>x ≥ 0;</p>
    <p>y ≥ 0;</p>
    <p>var result = min(5x + 4y);</p>
    <p>print(x, y, Result)</p>
</div>
